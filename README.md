# About

From guarding the Korean DMZ during my military service to graduating with distinction from the University of Waterloo, Iâ€™ve embraced every challenge with grit and curiosity. 

My journey hasnâ€™t been without obstaclesâ€”two years of job hunting pushed me to master TypeScript, Java, and AWS. Landing my first software engineering role was a milestone, but itâ€™s just the beginning. 

Each day, I strive to push boundaries, turn ideas into impactful solutions, and grow beyond "insufficient"â€”because growth is my constant companion.
